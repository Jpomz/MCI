# MCI
This is a tutorial on how to calculate an MCI score using R. 

MCI is the Macroinvertebrate Community Index, a commonly used biotic index to rate the quality of Fresh waters in New Zealand based on community species composition (mostly macroinvertebrates). 

This tutorial is primarily written for freshwater ecologists working in New Zealand with little experience using the R language. While explicitly aimed at calculating an MCI score for a given sampling location, I try and also provide useful tips and tricks for those interested in gaining broader programming experience. 

I hope you find this useful, and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
