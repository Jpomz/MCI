# MCI
This is a tutorial on how to calculate an MCI score using R. 

MCI is the Macroinvertebrate Community Index, a commonly used biotic index to rate the quality of Fresh waters in New Zealand based on community species composition (mostly macroinvertebrates). 

This tutorial is primarily written for freshwater ecologists working in New Zealand with little experience using the R language. While explicitly aimed at calculating an MCI score for a given sampling location, I try and also provide useful tips and tricks for those interested in gaining broader programming experience. 

I have also provided a "Just give me the code!" section at the end. This only contains the code I ran to calculate the metrics with no explanation. 

I hope you find this useful, and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Cheers, and happy coding.

PS - I'm currently having issues with the .html document to format properly, so have provided the .pdf document as well. You should be able to view the pdf document on the github page, or download it for future reference.
